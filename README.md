# LibTorch_test

Use this program to varify your LibTorch deployment. It is highly recommended using it on a [CUDA-capable](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) system.

After you have installed LibTorch by either

* [building from source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/docs/libtorch.rst#libtorch-c-only),

or

* following the instruction of [INSTALLING C++ DISTRIBUTIONS OF PYTORCH](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html) to download a LibTorch ZIP archive.

You can use this program by first clone this repo and

    cd <root-of-LibTorch_test>
    mkdir -p build && cd build

<details open>
  <summary>If you build LibTorch from source, <code>cmake</code> will take care of the rest.</summary>

    cmake ..
</details>

<details open>
  <summary>Or, if you use LibTorch ZIP archive, please specify the absolute (!) path to the unzipped LibTorch distribution.</summary>

    cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/absolute/path/to/libtorch/share/cmake ..
</details>

Then `make`

    make -j$(nproc)

Now you can run it

    ./libtorch_test

If everything goes well, you should see out put like
