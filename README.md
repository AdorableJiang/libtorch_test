# LibTorch_test

Use this program to varify your LibTorch deployment. It is highly recommended using it on a [CUDA-capable](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) system.

After you have installed LibTorch by either of

1. following the instruction of [INSTALLING C++ DISTRIBUTIONS OF PYTORCH](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html)

2. [building from source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/docs/libtorch.rst#libtorch-c-only)

you can use this program by first clone this repo and

    cd <root-of-LibTorch_test>
    mkdir -p build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j$(($(nproc) + 1))

Now you can run it

    ./libtorch_test

If everything goes well, you should see out put like

    LibTorch version: 1.11.0
